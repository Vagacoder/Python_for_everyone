Just like the wind
I've always been
Drifting high up in a sky that never ends
Through thick and thin
I always win
'Cause I will fight both life and death to save a friend
I face my destiny
Every day I live
And the best in me
Is all I have to give
Just like the sun
When my day's done
Sometimes I don't like the person I've become
Is the enemy within
Or a thousand men?
Should I walk the path
Of my worse or better half?
Is someone testing me
Every day I live?
Well, the best in me
Is all I have to give
I can pretend
I am the wind
And I don't know if I will pass this way again
All things must end
Good-bye my friend
Think of me when you see the sun or feel the wind
I am the wind I am the sun
And one day we'll all be one
I am the wind I am the sun
And one day we'll all be one
