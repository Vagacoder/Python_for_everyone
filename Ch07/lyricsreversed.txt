And one day we'll all be one
I am the wind I am the sun
And one day we'll all be one
I am the wind I am the sun
Think of me when you see the sun or feel the wind
Good-bye my friend
All things must end
And I don't know if I will pass this way again
I am the wind
I can pretend
Is all I have to give
Well, the best in me
Every day I live?
Is someone testing me
Of my worse or better half?
Should I walk the path
Or a thousand men?
Is the enemy within
Sometimes I don't like the person I've become
When my day's done
Just like the sun
Is all I have to give
And the best in me
Every day I live
I face my destiny
'Cause I will fight both life and death to save a friend
I always win
Through thick and thin
Drifting high up in a sky that never ends
I've always been
Just like the wind
